        Tag Helpers are the new HTML-friendly way to create views and define UI in ASP.NET MVC applications. They are recommended as the better alternative to traditional MVC HTML helpers, while still allowing you to extend the elements with server MVC functionality. Tag Helpers are also much more “understandable” to front end developers and designers.

        We at Telerik are working on Tag Helpers for the existing Telerik MVC components, and plan to include them as part of the product for the upcoming RC and RTM versions of ASP.NET Core MVC.
